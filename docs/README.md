# COPILOT AI POWERED VIDEO EDITING POWERED BY GITHUB COPILOT

Welcome to the documentation for the **Copilot AI Powered Video Editor**. This project is a comprehensive AI-powered video editing platform consisting of a Next.js frontend, a Node.js backend, and multiple Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

## AI Functions

The editor leverages the power of GitHub Copilot and other AI models to provide advanced video editing capabilities:

- **AI Script Generation**: Automatically generate video scripts from simple text prompts, outlining scenes, dialogue, and visual cues.
- **Smart Asset Search**: Intelligently search for and retrieve the perfect stock footage and images from providers like Pexels and Unsplash using natural language queries.
- **Video Analysis**: Analyze video content to understand context, identify objects, and extract metadata, enabling smarter editing decisions.
- **Automated Editing**: AI-driven cuts, transitions, and effects based on the content and desired style.
