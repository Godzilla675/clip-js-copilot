./app/(pages)/projects/[id]/page.tsx
49:8  Warning: React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'router'. Either include it or remove the dependency array.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
80:8  Warning: React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'currentProjectId'. Either include it or remove the dependency array.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

./app/components/editor/player/canvas-(not-used)/CanvasPreview.tsx
93:8  Warning: React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'dispatch', 'drawFrame', 'initCanvas', and 'isPlaying'. Either include them or remove the dependency array.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

635:21  Warning: Using `<img>` could result in slower LCP and higher bandwidth. Consider using `<Image />` from `next/image` to automatically optimize images. This may incur additional usage or cost from your provider. See: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/no-img-element  @next/next/no-img-element

./app/components/editor/player/remotion/Player.tsx
23:8  Warning: React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'isPlaying'. Either include it or remove the dependency array. Outer scope values like 'fps' aren't valid dependencies because mutating them doesn't re-render the component.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
36:24  Warning: The ref value 'playerRef.current' will likely have changed by the time this effect cleanup function runs. If this ref points to a node rendered by React, copy 'playerRef.current' to a variable inside the effect, and use that variable in the cleanup function.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
40:8  Warning: React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'dispatch'. Either include it or remove the dependency array.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

./app/components/editor/timeline/Header.tsx
